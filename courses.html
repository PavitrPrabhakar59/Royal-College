          <p>Computer Science is a course which deals with the study of the algorithmic process and the computational
            machines that are included in this course. Computer Science is a study which ranges from topics dealing with
            the theoretical studies of algorithms and information to the practical issues of implementing computing
            systems in the hardware as well as software.

          <p>Electronics Sciences is a sub-discipline of physics, technology and engineering which studies the
            controlled
            flow and emission of electrons in a vacuum, and matter. This differentiates it from electrical engineering
            as
            it utilizes active devices to control electron flow by rectification and amplification instead of using
            passive effects such as resistance, inductance and capacitance.
