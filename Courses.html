          <p>Electronics Sciences is a sub-discipline of physics, technology and engineering which studies the controlled
            flow and emission of electrons in a vacuum, and matter. This differentiates it from electrical engineering as
            it utilizes active devices to control electron flow by rectification and amplification instead of using
            passive effects such as resistance, inductance and capacitance.
